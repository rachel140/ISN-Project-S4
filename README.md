Usage Instructions:

To display the **map of the emerged land** for a specific year, use the scale to select your desired year. Once selected, click on **"Generate Map"** to display it. You can repeat the same process to view the map for a different year.

Use your mouse scroll wheel to **zoom in or out** on the map, allowing you to focus on specific regions or adjust the map size.

If you **click on France**, a **profile view** of the country will appear. This view shows the **land remaining above sea level**, along with a **height scale** indicating elevation. You can also change the year from this view using the same method as before.

To return to the main map, simply click the **"Quit"** button.

When you click on **"this button"** (replace with button name), and the selected year is later than 2022, the interface will calculate and display the **number of climate refugees per continent**. This is determined by multiplying the average population density of each continent by the land area that has submerged underwater.
