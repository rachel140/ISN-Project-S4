Usage Instructions:
To run the code, excute the class **MainView**.

To display the **map of the emerged land** for a specific year, use the scale to select your desired year. Once selected, click on **"Generate Map"** to display it. You can repeat the same process to view the map for a different year.

Use your mouse scroll wheel to **zoom in or out** on the map, allowing you to focus on specific regions or adjust the map size.

If you **click on France**, a **profile view** of the country will appear. This view shows the **land remaining above sea level**, along with a **height scale** indicating elevation. You can also change the year from this view using the same method as before.

To return to the main map, simply click the **"Quit"** button.

When you click on **"show refugees"**, and the selected year is later than 2022, the code will calculate and the interface will display the **number of climate refugees arounf the world**. This number represents both the refugees due to sea level rise and other climatic events (heatwaves, drought, flood, ...). This is determined by multiplying the average population density of each continent by the land area that has submerged underwater.
